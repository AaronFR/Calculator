## Java Calculator

#### Primary Goals
- Study of using Regex expressions and character replacement in Java
- Using Try-Catches to create a robust program
- Integrate direcltly with git through VSC (for frequent commiting)

#### Functionality
- Addition + 
- Subtraction -
- Multiplication *
- Division /
- Exponentaion ^

Instead of Bemdas (or similar) calculations are done left to right.
Supports multiple operations simultaneously. Eg dividing an exponent before adding this sum.
All numbers are represented as doubles.

#### Features to develop
- negative results
- Cleaner code: enumeration and format lists
- Robustness: Try catches and failure-proofing
